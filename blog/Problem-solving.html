          <tr>
              <td>Pseudocode</td>
              <td>Pseudocode is a plain language description of the steps required in a function or other algorithm. It can be used as a check list to clarify thinking around a problem.</td>
              <td>Pseudocode breaks down the bigger problem into parts so I can see what I need. Writing things out also makes the problem becomes clearer.</td>
          </tr>
              <td> The Rubber Ducky </td>
              <td>Similar to pseudocode the rubber duck method gets the user to break the code down using plain language. With this method the articulation can be verbal or written and is most often targeted at an inanimate object or pet. This method is used a lot in debugging where the code is explained line by line.</td>
              <td>I didn't know about this method prior to this exercise but like using it with my cat - it puts her right to sleep and allows me to talk through the problem.</td>
          <tr>
              <td>Reading Error Messages</td>
              <td>When code is not working an error message will show in console or similar depending on the programme you are using. These can be invaluable for pinpointing where in the code the problem is and sometimes what the problem is.</td>
              <td>I don't love getting errors but I love error messages. I find these messages very helpful as I am really bad at leaving out } etc and the error will often alert me to them making the fix process faster. </td>

            <td>Console.logging</td>
            <td>Console.log is a function that can print the output of code to the console so that the coder can view what the code is doing at a point when it's function might not necessarily be visually apparent. </td>
            <td>This is an invaluable tool for me especially when I am not confident that my code is actually outputting what I am intending it to - this tool gives me a way to check.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Googling</td>
            <td>Googling is an everyday pass time and problem solving method, there are great coding resources available such as mdn and w3schools. Google searches can be targeted with these entities to make the results more relevant.</td>
            <td>I feel like I use this method constantly though I feel I can improve in regards to my search terms/being able to word what I am looking for.</td>

            <td>Trying Something</td>
            <td>Give it a whirl! It can sometimes break the ice and get your head in the game or unblock you if you just put something on the page and try it out. Often this is also a great learning opportunity as through trial and error you can reflect on what worked and what didn't.</td>
            <td>I need to get better at this strategy as often I get stuck in my head about not wanting to get it wrong or needing to be able to do the whole thing at once. This stratergy will help me develop as a coder.</td>

            <td>Asking for Help</td>
            <td>As hard as it is sometimes, if you are blocked for too long asking for help can be a great method. Other people can explain things in different ways or with analogies and sometimes having an external view point will be able to target where the hole in your knowledge or problem is.</td>
            <td>People be it peers or tutors/facilitators are a wonderful resource. I need to get better at making use of this opportuity through the provided channels.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Reflection</td>
          <td>Reflecting on something allows you to see the areas you need to focus your attention on to improve, it also allows you to review the positives and this reinforces those strategies.</td>
          <td>I think that most of us do this as part of the natural course of our learning, however it is good that each unit of this course has associated reflection points so one can 'check -in' with their progress.</td>

    <h2>What was a problem you had, what techniques did you use, how did you feel, what did you learn?</h2>

    <P>
      The problem that I was blocked on and the problem that I found a solution to that I was happy with are the say problem. 
      The problem was that I had a function – a process to be carried out on an array of data but I needed to be able to return that process as a new set of data (array). 
      This could be achieved using a .map method but I was having difficulty with the structure. 
    </P>

    <p>
      I used a combination of problem solving techniques including using pseudo code and googling etc. A method that I hadn’t come across but found quite amusing was the rubber ducky method – quite similar to pseudo code – it is where you break down the problem in plain language and talk it through with a rubber duck – in my case I did this with my cat. 
    </p>

    <p>
      A lot of the time I felt frustrated but obviously it is very satisfying when you are able to translate what you know needs to happen into the correct structure for it to happen in JS. 
    </p>

    <p>
      To keep going, I thought I had learnt about .map method but it turns out I still need a lot of practice as my brain has managed to muddle it again but it is an interesting process.
