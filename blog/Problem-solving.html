    <h2>What was a problem you had, what techniques did you use, how did you feel, what did you learn?</h2>

    <P>
      The problem that I was blocked on and the problem that I found a solution to that I was happy with are the say problem. 
      The problem was that I had a function – a process to be carried out on an array of data but I needed to be able to return that process as a new set of data (array). 
      This could be achieved using a .map method but I was having difficulty with the structure. 
    </P>

    <p>
      I used a combination of problem solving techniques including using pseudo code and googling etc. A method that I hadn’t come across but found quite amusing was the rubber ducky method – quite similar to pseudo code – it is where you break down the problem in plain language and talk it through with a rubber duck – in my case I did this with my cat. 
    </p>

    <p>
      A lot of the time I felt frustrated but obviously it is very satisfying when you are able to translate what you know needs to happen into the correct structure for it to happen in JS. 
    </p>

    <p>
      To keep going, I thought I had learnt about .map method but it turns out I still need a lot of practice as my brain has managed to muddle it again but it is an interesting process.
