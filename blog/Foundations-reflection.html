      <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        I have reinforced the knowledge that I really like coding, <br>
        That I need to take more micro breaks then I thought, <br>
        And that I like discussing code with my cat â€“ probably shouldnâ€™t tell to many people about that one. 

      </p>

      <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
      <p>
        I donâ€™t think the role of values , self-awareness and empathy in learning and programming vary much from their role in all elements of our lives. They guide our actions, mind set and how we interact with others amongst other things. 
        Coding often works to solve problems, present information to people and/ or to make tasks easier for people. A strong empathetic drive can be seen as being useful in order to fully comprehend the needs of others and make the experience you are creating accessible and tailored to its audience. In this way coding can also reinforce empathetic interaction.

      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        I guess I have been surprised by the topics covered. 
      </p>

      <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        I have found the time it takes and wording what are fairly abstract concepts difficult. 
      </p>
      
      <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
      <p>
        To have well rounded graduates that have the self-knowledge and confidence to interact with and fit into many different employment situations. They will also have an understanding of peoples experiences outside their own which will make them more well-rounded coders able to cater to various user groups.  
      </p>

      <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer</h2>
      <p>
        I feel that the content covered in the core section of the course is incredibly important and I believe that I comprehend (though I may not be able to explain well in words) why time is being spent on these skills. However, if I am honest, at this point in my journey I would love that extra time to put the research into the tech components. Though core skills never stop developing and should always be considered, I have addressed many of the core skills covered in my previous career so I feel like I have a great deficit in my tech knowledge vs some knowledge of the core topics, I would like to feel more balance between the two. In summary, I see the core content as (naturally) important to everyoneâ€™s lives. I donâ€™t begrudge going over it as there is always something to be learnt. I do however feel that it takes up a lot of time and I would have liked to put more of that time into practicing programming ðŸ˜¯.
