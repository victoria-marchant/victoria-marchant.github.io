      <p>My long term career goal remains fluid. I am excited to enter the tech world but want to be open to whatever loves or dislikes may develop. However, foundations has reeinforced that I can see myself heading more for a back end development role. My history in Healthcare still leads me to be interested in seeing what is happening in that space.</p>
  <p>
    My ideas regarding my strengths and limitations have not changed a great deal over the foundations experience. I have found that I needed to take more breaks than I anticipated due to my brain taking time to take things in. I think I will need to coordinate micro breaks with my coding partners going into bootcamp or look to some other strategies.
  </p>

  <p>
    I think that my biggest non- technical challenges during bootcamp will be my own judgement of where I should be up to in my learning and my inability to be the family member I want to be. I also think staying on top of the material and speaking in front of people will be challenging. I will use strategies such as mindfulness, open communication time management and self-talk to deal with these. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Given that I think it will be a challenge I would like to work on my time management and get better at it over the bootcamp period. I think that the routine of bootcamp will help with this. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I don‚Äôt think that my expectations of the bootcamp team vary much from what I expected and experienced from the foundations team. I found the team to all be very helpful, kind and invested in the cohorts' learning journey. I believe that most people want to be approached with Respect, kindness, honesty, etc. I am no different and attempt to engage in my interactions in this manner.
  </p>

  <p>
    Approaching bootcamp I hope to be open and present, to not be too judgemental of myself, to give myself the space to have fun as well as learn, and to get as much out of this learning experience as my brain will take. Onwards! üëç
