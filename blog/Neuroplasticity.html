    <p>
      Neuroplasticity describes the brain's ability to change, and adapt at both a functional and structural level (growth and reorganisation) throughout one’s life throughout life in response to an individual’s experiences or environment. 
      Neuroplasticity is the linchpin of recovery from events such as stroke and TBI. However as the description suggests it is also necessary for everyday learning and individual growth.

      Here is a <a target = "_blank" href=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/neuroplasticity>link</a> to a science direct topic page. Though this is just the tip of a very large iceberg and is healthcare related it illustrates how many different conditions require neuroplastic change as part of their treatment trajectory.

    <h3>How To Improve Neuroplasticity</h3>

    <p>
      Creating a good neural environment for change to occur is helpful to neuroplasticity - this can be achieved through mindfulness and exercise these two activities are consistently documented in the research as being of great importance to improving outcomes across the board. Mindfulness when done consistently can create it's own changes to the way people think/process stimulus, which in turn can increase the efficiency of neural changes and learning. 
      Neuroplastic change is stimulated by challenge and novel stimulus and potentiated by repetition and importance placed on the stimulus. 
      So, exposure to new concepts, doing puzzles etc, doing this often, and being engaged with what you are doing are going to improve your chances of long term brain change.

    <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
   
    <p>
      A growth mindset is crucial for taking people to their full potential and allowing them to be resilient to the challenges that are inherent in the learning process. 
      Carol Dweck, a professor at Stanford University and one of the main proponents of Mindset psychology defines fixed and growth mindset as quoted below: 
    </p>

    <p>
      "In a <strong>fixed mindset</strong> students believe their basic abilities, their intelligence, their talents, are just fixed traits. They have a certain amount and that’s that, and then their goal becomes to look smart all the time and never look dumb."
    </p>

    <p>
      "In a <strong>growth mindset</strong> students understand that their talents and abilities can be developed through effort, good teaching and persistence. They don’t necessarily think everyone’s the same or anyone can be Einstein, but they believe everyone can get smarter if they work at it."
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is a <a target = "_blank" href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nF90sAW-Yg>link</a> to a video about the growth mindset.

    <h3>Learning Plan</h3>

    <p>
      Use of a growth mindset while approaching the new information presented in this course will be crucial, however this is easier said than done 100% of the time. 
      It will be helpful to remember when feeling overwhelmed by challenges that they are opportunities for learning and growth. I will strive to frame blocks in these terms rather than feeling them as outright failures.
