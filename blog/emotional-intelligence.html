      <h2>The Difference Between EQ and IQ</h2>
     <p>IQ and EQ stand for Intelligence Quotient and Emotional Quotient respectively. Both refer to tests that seek to quantify an estimation of either someone’s cognitive intelligence (IQ) or their emotional intelligence (EQ). As terms IQ predates EQ first being coined and used in the Early 1900's. Use of the term 'Emotional intelligence' seems to appear in the 1960's with reference to a quotient or measuring emotional intelligence not appearing until the 1980's</p>
<p>David Wechsler a psychologist involved in developing intelligence scales defined intelligence as ‘The aggregate or global capacity of the individual to act purposefully, to think rationally, and to deal effectively with his environment." IQ (a measure of intelligence) tests skills such as memory, quantitative and fluid reasoning as well as visual and spatial processing.</p>
      <p>As with Intelligence there are various definitions and models of emotional intelligence. Peter Salovey and John Mayer define it as “the ability to monitor one's own and other people's emotions, to discriminate between different emotions and label them appropriately, and to use emotional information to guide thinking and behaviour".</p>
<p>Various models of EI gives rise to traits to be tested to give someone’s EQ. Examples of these traits are perceiving emotions, using emotions, understanding emotions and managing emotions. Emotional intelligence is a more abstract ability to test given that questions to assess it often do not have objectively defined results and instead rightness or wrongness is graded against normative values for a population. </p>

       <h2>Why Is EQ important</h2>
<p>EQ is important as it it creates a steady environment in which to showcase other skills, the motivation to hone and use those skills, and aids in the ability to work with others, recruiting their skill sets.
  It is emotional intelligence that is largely responsible for happiness, motivation and perseverence which means that it has a dirrect effect on performance. EI is also key to ones ability to collaborate and lead in all manner of situations.</p>
