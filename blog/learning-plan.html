<p>My long term career goal lacks clarity at present. I am excited to enter the tech world but want to be open to whatever loves or dislikes may develop. However, at this point in time I see myself heading more for a back end development role. I have a history in Healthcare so it may be interesting to see what is happening in that space – I think the potential for tech to overcome many accessibility issues in terms of education, risk factor analysis, and integration of health benefiting programmes is immense.</p> 

  <p>Nevertheless in order to reach any career in this field a lot (lot) of learning will have to go on first (and afterwards). Unfortunately, I am a fairly lousy learner with weaknesses such as slow processing, at times poor time management (you see the irony) and issues with spelling and grammar. But… I am persistent, hugely dedicated to taking on new knowledge and finding out how things work. I enjoy seeking  information in various forms and  drawing in parallels.</p>   
  
  <p>The workload and commitment of time to this course is very intense, in such an environment things can sometimes get to you more than they would in a less pressured setting. I will be trying to ameliorate this for myself by taking a break/pause, if I am able. Preferably away from the screen maybe to make a cup of tea, go for a walk or climb. If this is not possible I feel my best strategy will be take a breath and feel my feet on the floor in order to recentre and gain clarity over what is the next step forward without being swamped by the big picture. 
  Should the issue be a problem that I have that I can’t solve on my own I will seek help through appropriate channels. I will use the time allocations on tasks and my common sense as a guide to decide when to reach out. I will be looking to google, my peers through discord, and my facilitators as possible channels for assistance.</p>
  
  <p>When I interact with people I always endeavour to do so respectfully. During this course I will be attempting to be constructive where I feel I can add something, and take on feedback where it is given.
  I am looking forward to getting a better sense of who the people in my group and wider cohort are through our interactions on discord, our weekly check-ins, and reading their blog information should they make it accessible to me. 
  Where those opportunities arise I will be seeking to approach industry and community representatives with honesty and openness.
  Where possible and appropriate I will always try to bring some humour to interactions as I feel that when people are at ease communication is freer and more fluid.</p>
  
  <p>My experiences with the facilitation team so far have been wonderful and I have no reason to believe that this would change. I have found them to be knowledgeable, open, helpful and kind with the way they guide learning. This is to me what I want in a team tasked with enabling learning and growth.</p>
  
  <p>Whilst it is my intention to commit a great portion of my time to this learning process I also acknowledge that it is important for me to have time away from a screen and to still be an active participant in my life outside this course – the housework won’t do itself. I will be hoping to put aside a small amount of time each day to go for a short walk and climb in the evenings two times a week. My family is a very supportive one and they are well informed as to my commitments at present, they also know that I am happy to talk to them about code – thus far no takers.</p>
  
  <p>I am very grateful for this opportunity to learn and gain experience in a field that has intrigued me for so long. I look forward to working with you all. Thanks 
