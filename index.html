    <p>This is an image of Sergei Rachmaninoff taken in 1921 it is sourced from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Rachmaninoff." target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Rachmaninoff.</a> If you click the picture the link will take you to a video of Rubinstein playing Rachmaninoff's 18th Variation from Rhapsody on a Theme by Paganini. I Have added this as a) I thnk it is a beautiful piece of music but b) because to me he Rhachmaninoff has done what coders do - he has recombined elements of a pre existing theme written by Paganini to create something new and beautiful. Enjoy! </p>
